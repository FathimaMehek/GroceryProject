The code consists of two versions for managing a grocery store: one with PDF receipt generation using the `reportlab` library and one without. 
Both versions handle basic operations such as reading and writing grocery data, displaying a menu, adding, updating, and removing items, and generating a receipt. 
The first version creates a PDF receipt with colorful elements, tables, and headers, using the `reportlab` library. 
It supports customer shopping, updating the stock, and saving the receipt as a PDF. 
The second version operates in the console without PDF output, displaying the grocery list, updating items, and generating a simple text receipt.
Both versions use functions to interact with the CSV file for storing and modifying grocery data.
